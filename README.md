Overview
--------
This demo shows how to use [Biometric-Prompt](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/biometrics/BiometricPrompt) with [Android Keystore](https://developer.android.com/training/articles/keystore) in order to encrypt and decrypt data using your fingerprint in [Android Nougat](https://www.android.com/versions/nougat-7-0/) devices.

Since it is just a demo, not a production ready version, it's not covering all the exception and cases that can arise due to the usage of fingerprint like Hardware not available or lock screen not set up, to name few.

Usage
------
Just Import the project into Android Studio and run it with gradle from Android Studio, it should deploy it to your device.

## License
The KIVRA Fingerprint Keystore sample uses an [MIT license](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License). So go ahead and do what
you want!

Lots of fun!
